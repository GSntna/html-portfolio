# Personal Blog

Welcome to my [personal blog](www.gsantanav.com). Here you can get to know a
little bit about me and check out some of my notes on some of the courses and
the projects I've done.

This is also the place where I'll be applying all I've learned on my
[Web Development Bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gG3@HtxhpqRYvnk-vqMugkjSL0lVBLllhKAPHMMWCeaUfn5HCRy8ExFquIMgiV6JpBPAMg==/),
stay tuned!
